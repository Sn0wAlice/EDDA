Event Driven Dynamic Architecture

## What is EDDA?

**Event-Driven Dynamic Architecture** (EDDA) extends the principles of *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDA) by incorporating events as dynamic sources of data that can trigger new consumers or workflows in real-time. In EDDA, data exploration isn’t limited to static datasets but also includes event streams generated by user interactions, IoT devices, or system logs. These events not only provide immediate insights but can also act as triggers for additional analytical processes or new consumer pipelines, enabling adaptive and iterative data exploration. This approach is particularly powerful in scenarios requiring real-time data-driven decisions, such as fraud detection, monitoring, or personalized user experiences, blending traditional EDA techniques with the responsiveness of event-driven systems.

## Install
Here is a simple process to install Rust on your system:

1.	Open a terminal.
2.	Run the following command to install rustup, Rust’s installer and version manager:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
3.	Follow the on-screen instructions. By default, this will install Rust and set up your environment.
4.	Once the installation is complete, update your shell environment by adding Rust to your PATH. This is usually done automatically.
5.	If not, source your shell profile manually:
```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
6.	Check if Rust is installed correctly by running:
``` bash 
rustc --version # This will display the installed Rust compiler version.
```
7. Clone the repository and run the following command to build the project:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Sn0wAlice/EDDA/
cd EDDA
cargo run
```

## Usage
as you want bro, i fucking don't care

## Client ?
Clients can be found in `./clients` directory, you can use them to interact with the server.
